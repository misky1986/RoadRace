# RoadRace
A cycle competition app.
This app is only a hobby project to learn Node.js, with express.js, gulp and angular2.
I'll use npm fo fetching backend/server frameworks
I will us Bower from fetching frontend frameworks like Twitter-Bootstrap.
The backend will serve a REST api, that the frontend (Angular2) will use.
